Capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the User Terms and Conditions, which is available at <a class="link" href="./user_terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>, unless otherwise defined.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">We respect your right to privacy. Generally, we will not make your personal information available to third parties without your consent, subject to this privacy policy.

          <h2 class="header">Personal Information</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">“Personal Information” is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a customer’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, linked social media account, or information about activities directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases. Personal Information also includes information that you may choose to provide to us, such as your educational, consumer, and employment history profile. We collect Personal Information that you provide to us, such as when you register at the Website, or use the Application, provide us with any information, or otherwise contact us, when you use any services that we make available, or when you take any consumer actions with respect to participating merchants (including making purchases or entering the physical location of such merchant).</p>
          <p class="paragraph">If you choose to provide Personal Information to us, we will not share this information with third parties without your explicit permission, except when required by law, regulation, subpoena, or court order, or as expressly set forth herein.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">We may use Personal Information internally – for example, to process your visits and provide you with reliable loyalty plans and rewards and to tell you about specific goods and services we believe will be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive promotional information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can contact us at any time to decline promotional information by emailing us at contact @localloot.app. In addition, we use Personal Information to diagnose problems with our servers, to make the Website and Application more useful, and to customize the Application and personalize its content for you.</p>
