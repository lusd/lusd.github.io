      <h1>General Rules and Practices for
          Writing Great Product Copy for CBSi
      </h1>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul class="unordered">
          <li><b>Be concise.</b> While "clean" (error-free) copy is always Priority No. 1, this is a big one as well. Fit as much pertinent information into your copy as possible while keeping unnecessary wordiness to a minimum.
            <ul class="unordered">
              <li>For example, "lets you" is a much more concise way of saying "enables you to." "In order to" can almost always just be "to." "That is" can almost always be omitted.</li>
              <li>If you're writing about "The Last of Us for the PlayStation 3," write it just like that. You don't need to say "this The Last of Us video game for the PlayStation 3." The product type is clear from the context.</li>
              <li><span class="bluecolor">Note:</span> Being concise as a general guideline doesn't always mean you're expected to convey the message in as few words as possible. That's true of the 60 words or less product description projects, for example, but some projects will allow (and even encourage) you to be more descriptive to fit a certain word count. These will be clearly defined.
                <ul class="unordered">
                  <li>Regardless, get in the habit of writing tight, clear, direct copy. Even when you're writing for longer word counts, the best copy keeps fluff to a minimum and gives the reader the most bang for the buck.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Use simple words (and phrasing).</b> Some writers believe in using "big" words, breaking out the thesaurus and showing off their vocabulary. Don't do that. Copy that sells products is straightforward and easy to understand. It's good to change up the wording as needed (see directly below), but keep the terminology and sentence structure simple and direct.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Avoid repetitive wording.</b> If you're writing a short product description and the product is a printer, don't say "printer" over and over in the PD. Swap it out for a pronoun or synonym when you can (except when you're meeting the two keyword placement requirements).
            <ul>
              <li>Example: "The waterproof zipper protects your <b>laptop</b> from moisture, and the faux fur lining on this Rareform <b>laptop</b> sleeve cradles your <b>laptop</b> in softness."
                <ul>
                  <li>That's from an actual PD we reviewed in the past, and it obviously reads terribly. Writers and editors are expected to do their best to minimize word (and phrasing) repetition.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li><b>You're encouraged to use common contractions.</b> Avoid weird contractions such as "they'll" or the (truly terrible) "I'd've," but do use common contractions such as "doesn't" or "won't." </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Avoid "ease of cleaning" information for the most part.</b> Sometimes this info is extremely pertinent, but more often, it's a means for tricky writers to "fluff up" the word count without providing useful information to the consumer.
            <ul>
              <li>You can include such info if it's truly pertinent or absolutely needed to fill word count on a very simple item, but please keep it simple and short.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Don't explain how to install a simple product</b> (such as a replacement bulb) or how to replace a printer cartridge, etc., unless it's extremely relevant or absolutely needed to fill word count.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Cover the most pertinent details.</b> If you're writing about a computer, it should generally include such <u>key details</u> as the processor type/speed, hard drive size, RAM, etc.
            <ul>
              <li>If a given description could match 80 percent of computers, it's not acceptable. What elements make <u>this</u> computer different from others?</li>
              <li>Similarly, a cell phone description should include the most important things that distinguish it from others.</li>
              <li>If it's an incredibly simple, generic item, you don't need to get wildly creative: We realize there's not much to say about such products. Just keep it simple and straightforward.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Understand the difference between the "brand name" part of the keyword and the "generic" part.</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Here's how it works: The keyword typically is the <u>brand name</u> and <u>specific product name</u> (e.g., "Targus Protek sleeve.") Keep it as simple as possible.</li>
              <li><b>Capitalize</b> the "proper" part of the name and <b>lowercase</b> the "generic" part. (This is explained further under "Capitalization.")</li>
              <li>Make sure to include the primary brand name: "Samsung Galaxy S7," not just "Galaxy S7."</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Properly format brand names, even if they're weird. Some brands</b> apply ridiculous styles to their brand names and products to make them stand out, such as making them lowercase or in ALL-CAPS.
            <ul>
              <li>If you have a brand name with an odd style, first check to see whether this particular project has a listed style for the brand name. If you don't find one, go to the brand's website and use the style that appears proper.</li>
              <li>If you find conflicting styles or are otherwise really stuck, inquire in the community forums.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Write in present tense.</b> Say a product does something, not that it "will" or "can" do something. (On a related note, don't say it's "designed to do" something. That's fluff. Just say what it does.)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Avoid "you"/"your" overuse.</b> The vast majority of marketing copy is written in the second person, but that doesn't mean it needs to be inundated with references to "you" and/or "your." Such repetition makes copy read poorly. Use these terms when necessary for clarity, but omit them when they're not needed.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block">
        <ul>
          <li class="bluecolor"><u>Good:</u> Use these terms when necessary for clarity, but omit them when they're not needed.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    <div class="text-block">
      <ul>
        <li class="redcolor"><b><u>Bad</u>: <u>You</u> should use these terms when <u>you</u> consider them necessary for clarity in <u>your</u> copy, but <u>you</u> should omit them when <u>you</u> don't think they're needed.</b></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block">
      <ul>
        <li><b>No boilerplating or plagiarism.</b> To be clear, this is a <u>zero-tolerance issue.</u> If substantial sections of text are copied verbatim from other sources (or "virtually verbatim," with only a tweaked word or two here and there), the copy will not be accepted, and the writer will face serious consequences.
          <ul>
            <li>Take the source info and <u>write a compelling description in your own words.</u> It can be challenging to write several product descriptions in a row about very similar items, but be creative and find at least slightly different ways to phrase each one.</li>
            <li>However, if you have to write multiple slight variations on a very simple item such as a doorstop (it happens), it's better to <u>be simple and clear</u> than to use super-creative new phrasing that doesn't read well. </li>
          </ul>
